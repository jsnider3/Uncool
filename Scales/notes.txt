* There's something weird about classes vs objects. I should probably
find out soon.
* Scala has [Type] to do type-parameterization.
* Case classes are the Scala way to do ADT.
* Scala `Seq` and `List` have lengthCompare methods, to check if
  something's length is </> a certain value. This is weirdly optimized.
